# Robocorp Automation Courses

This repo holds my solutions for all [automation courses](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses) provided by Robocorp. There are three certification levels, and each level has its own branch in this repo. Check them out!

**DISCLAIMER:** There is room for much optimization in this codebase: logging, exception handling, object orientation, etc. I'm aware of this, and decided to keep it simple in order to focus on the knowledge offered by the courses. These robots are not intended to be used in production.
